# WTA-Hike-Seasonality
This project analyzes the Washington Trails Association (WTA) data on hikes and corresponding trip reports to estimate the seasonal availability of hikes in different regions.  Additionally, the available data will be used to estimate the necessary equipment for the trip at different times of the year.
